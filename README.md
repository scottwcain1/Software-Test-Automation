# CS 320 Portfolio Submission

## Overview
This repository contains artifacts from CS 320, highlighting my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. From **Project One**, I have included the `Contact.java`, `ContactService.java`, `ContactTest.java`, and `ContactServiceTest.java` files. From **Project Two**, I have included the summary and reflections report. These materials demonstrate my ability to create unit tests to uncover errors, analyze software testing approaches, and apply strategies to ensure requirements are met.

Additionally, this README provides reflections on the work I have done in these projects, outlining my approach to ensuring functionality and security, interpreting user needs, and designing software effectively.

## Reflections

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Ensuring functionality and security requires a combination of thorough testing, adherence to coding standards, and a strong focus on best practices. I implemented unit tests to validate the functionality of individual components and conducted rigorous testing for edge cases to identify potential errors. To enhance security, I followed secure coding principles and prioritized data validation and error handling.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Understanding user needs starts with analyzing requirements and seeking feedback. For these projects, I reviewed the requirements documents and ensured my solutions addressed the specified use cases. By focusing on clarity, usability, and adaptability in my code, I was able to align the program features with the expected outcomes. Regular testing and validation against requirements helped ensure user needs were met effectively.

### How do I approach designing software?
My approach to software design emphasizes careful planning and structured development. I began by outlining the program's architecture, identifying key components, and determining their interactions. Using principles like modularity and reusability, I created designs that are both efficient and maintainable. This process included creating detailed test plans to verify functionality throughout the development cycle.
